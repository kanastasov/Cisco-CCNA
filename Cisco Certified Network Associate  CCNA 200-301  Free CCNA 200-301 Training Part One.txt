TCP/IP networking model:

The two tcp/ip networking

The new model has network,datalink,physical + application and transport as old one.

So the physical layer is wire, cable.


We can send reliably or not reliably.


OCI network model


Application layer is when you use the user staff.

Presentation layer is ASCII text binary, JPEG and encryptions.

Session layer how to start controlling end to conversations and includes control management of the bidirectional communicate messages that are being send.

Transport Layer is where your TCP is, provided control of the data that is being send from point a to bpoint b. TCP send and resent or UDP just send once.

What is local area network? LAN

Connection like internet cable and port like in the router to be pluged in.

Lab1:

Router: enable

show run

config t
hostname R1

config t
ip addr 172.1.1.255.255.255.252
int g0/0
ip
ip addr
ip addr 172.1.1.255.255.255.252

no shut

show ip int brief


Lab2:

?

int g0/1

ip addres 192.168.1.1 ?

no shut

ip int brief

show up int brief

show run
