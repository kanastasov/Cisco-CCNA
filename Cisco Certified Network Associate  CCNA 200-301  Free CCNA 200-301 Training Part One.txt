TCP/IP networking model:

The two tcp/ip networking

The new model has network,datalink,physical + application and transport as old one.

So the physical layer is wire, cable.


We can send reliably or not reliably.


OCI network model


Application layer is when you use the user staff.

Presentation layer is ASCII text binary, JPEG and encryptions.

Session layer how to start controlling end to conversations and includes control management of the bidirectional communicate messages that are being send.

Transport Layer is where your TCP is, provided control of the data that is being send from point a to bpoint b. TCP send and resent or UDP just send once.
